## What is it?

 Linked List is a data structure
 
## Different Types of Linked List
1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular Linked List
4. A Memory-Efficient Doubly Linked List
5. Unrolled Linked List
6. Skip List

## Advantages
	1. Dynamic data structure. - Linked List can grow and shrink at run time.
	2. Efficient Memory Utilization. - Because we don't need to pre-allocate memory for all the elements.
	3. Add and delete operations for elements are easy.
 4. Stack & Queue Implementation.- We can easily implement Stack & Queue using Linked list. 

## Disadvantages
	1. Extra memory for each node of Linked list as we have to store next node address in the linked list. 
	2. Random access for element. - We cannot search nth element in O(1).
 3. Reverse traversing. - Difficult to reverse Linked list. We can do reverse traverse easily using doubly linked list but it required extra pointer to store pervious node.
